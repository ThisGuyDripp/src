# **Miller Indices Calculator \- Development Changelog**

This log summarizes the key iterations and fixes applied to the Miller Indices Calculator based on our conversation.

### **1\. Initial Goal: Accuracy and PDF Matching**

* **Request:** Fix the accuracy of the Miller Indices calculator to precisely match the student material provided (PDF).

### **2\. Cubic System Accuracy Correction**

* **Issue Identified:** The initial mapping of Miller indices (h,k,l) to the crystallographic axes (a,b,c) and subsequently to the visual 3D axes (x,y,z) for the cubic system was incorrect.  
* **Solution:**  
  * Updated InterceptCalculator.js.  
  * Corrected the interpretation of h, k, l to correspond to the a, b, c axes respectively.  
  * Ensured the plane normal and intercept calculations for the cubic system aligned with standard conventions and the visual axis setup (a-axis as visual Z, b-axis as visual X, c-axis as visual Y).

### **3\. Hexagonal Default Shape \- Visual Adjustments**

* **Iteration 1: Simple Prism Request (vs. Bipyramid)**  
  * **Issue:** The default hexagonal background shape (a bipyramid \- prism with pyramid caps) was not matching a simpler hexagonal prism example from the PDF.  
  * **Solution:** Modified createHexagonalShape\_Custom in AxisSystem.js to generate a simple, flat-topped hexagonal prism.  
* **Iteration 2: Reverting to Bipyramid (User Clarification)**  
  * **Clarification:** The simple prism was not the universally desired shape; the bipyramid was actually closer to other general hexagonal crystal habits shown in the PDF.  
  * **Solution:** Updated createHexagonalShape\_Custom in AxisSystem.js to revert to generating a hexagonal prism with pyramidal caps.  
* **Iteration 3: Confirming Simple Prism (Specific PDF Image)**  
  * **Clarification:** User provided a specific PDF image showing a simple, flat-topped hexagonal prism as the target.  
  * **Solution:** Re-modified createHexagonalShape\_Custom in AxisSystem.js to ensure it generates a simple hexagonal prism without pyramidal caps.

### **4\. Hexagonal System Orientation**

* **Issue Identified:** The hexagonal system's c-axis was initially oriented horizontally in the 3D view. The desired orientation (as per typical diagrams) was a vertical c-axis.  
* **Solution:**  
  * Modified AxisSystem.js:  
    * Reoriented the hexagonal c-axis to align with the visual Y-axis (vertical).  
    * Positioned the a1, a2, and a3 axes within the visual XZ-plane (horizontal).  
    * Adjusted the default hexagonal prism construction, axis labels, and unit markers to reflect this new orientation.  
  * Updated config.js (DEFAULT\_SHAPE.HEXAGONAL.heightFactor and radiusFactor) to achieve proportions for the vertical prism that better matched PDF examples (taller and relatively thinner).

### **5\. Generated Miller Plane \- Visual Enhancements**

* **Issue Identified:** The generated Miller planes were generic THREE.PlaneGeometry and did not appear bounded by the unit cell or match the specific shapes (triangles, squares) shown in the PDF examples.  
* **Solution:**  
  * Significantly updated the createPlane method in MillerVisualizer.js:  
    * **Coordinate Transformation (Hexagonal):** Implemented transformation of hexagonal calculation results from the calculator's internal coordinate system (c-axis along Z) to the visual system (c-axis along Y) before plane construction.  
    * **Cubic System:**  
      * For 3 finite intercepts (e.g., (111)): Draws a triangle using the intersection points.  
      * For 1 finite intercept (e.g., (100)): Draws a square representing a unit cell face.  
    * **Hexagonal System (Post-Transformation):**  
      * Basal plane (000l): Draws a hexagon.  
      * Prism face (hki0): Attempts to draw a rectangle based on two distinct 'a' intercepts and prism height.  
      * Pyramidal/General (hkil with lâ‰ 0): Attempts to draw a triangle using the c-intercept and two distinct 'a' intercepts.  
    * **Material:** Plane opacity and color are now driven by CONFIG.PLANE values for a more solid appearance.

### **6\. Debugging and Fine-Tuning**

* **Issue: Hexagonal Plane Not Changing**  
  * **Symptom:** The visualized plane for the hexagonal system remained static despite changing Miller indices.  
  * **Root Cause (Console Log):** Creating plane for system: undefined... indicated that the system property was missing from the parameters object passed from InterceptCalculator.js to MillerVisualizer.js.  
  * **Fix:** Updated InterceptCalculator.js (\_calculateCubicIntercepts and \_calculateHexagonalIntercepts) to ensure the system string was included in the returned parameters object.  
* **Issue: level.toLowerCase is not a function Error**  
  * **Symptom:** A JavaScript TypeError in CONFIG\_UTILS.debug due to incorrect argument types.  
  * **Fix:**  
    * Made CONFIG\_UTILS.debug in config.js more robust to handle its level and optional data arguments correctly.  
    * Ensured MillerVisualizer.js calls CONFIG\_UTILS.debug with the correct argument structure.  
* **Issue: Default Shapes \- Cleaner Wireframes**  
  * **Request:** Remove unnecessary triangulation lines from the wireframe view of the default cubic and hexagonal shapes for a cleaner outline.  
  * **Solution:** Modified createCubicShape and createHexagonalShape\_Custom in AxisSystem.js to use THREE.EdgesGeometry and THREE.LineSegments when shapeConfig.wireframe is true. This renders only the prominent edges of the shapes.

This iterative process of identifying issues, implementing solutions, and refining based on feedback has significantly improved the calculator's accuracy and visual representation.
